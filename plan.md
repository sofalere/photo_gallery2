Overview:
  create a slideshow page
  create a photo gallery based on data that we receive from our API server that will allow us to like and favorite a photo
  comments for each photo will be rendered below the slideshow 
  form will allow us to send new comments back via AJAX
  when the slideshow advances, the details of the photo and the comments are re-rendered to match the visible image

  ::clickable to add a favorite to the current photo

Comments List:

Comment:
  user photo
  user name
  comment text
  date submitted

Comment Form:
  name

  comment text
  ::submit button "Post Comment" to add comment to the comments list of that photo

APPROACH
Each photo has to be tied in with a photo description, name of photo, the date it was taken and a list of its likes, favorites, comments
  each photo can be given an id, description, name of photo, the date it was taken on, number indicating likes, number inidacting favorites
  each comment can be saved with a photo id
  a photos comments list can be loaded each time with a search for the photo id in all comments

To get our data we can `GET` all photos, this means we can make one request when opening the page and create a `Photo` object from each of them and add them to a local storage variable. Display photo 1 from storage. Autofill sections: !!based on response body. `Like` and `Favorite` buttons are always displayed but must be submitted to the right `photo_id`. Update the UI AND the `Comment` object properties based off the like or favorite `POST` request body. We can also `GET` comments with id of photo as param, so when we display a photo, we make that request and populate a `CommentsList` object with newly created `Comment` objects. Then  A `CommentForm` is always displayed, but must be submitted with the right `photo_id`. 


DATA STRUCTURES:

Data will all be gathered from API, an HTML skeleton is only required
  name of photo album heading `Henrys Cat Pics`

    -slide with photo- 
    -title-
    -caption-
    -date-
    like button -quantity-
    favorite button -quantity-
  comments heading `Comments`
  comments list
    -comment++- //#each handlebar?
      -name-

      -comment-
  comment form heading `Your Comment`
    input `Your Name`
    input `Your Email`
    input `Comment`
    submit button `Post Comment`

sideshow:
  whole element set to `position: relative`, and each slide to `position: absolute`, to stack them
  set up HTML to have a `slideshow` element


requests:
  query params: 
    url encode them and add to url in `xhr.open`
   OR `fetch('https://example.com?' + new URLSearchParams({`
        `foo: 'value',`
       ` bar: 2,`
      `}))`

getting slides:
  `const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/photos");`
  `const jsonData = await response.json();`
  response:
    array of json data objects
    [{src: link to photo str, 
      title: photo title str,
      caption: ... str,
      created_at: date string,
      favorites: num,
      id: num,
      likes: num}, 
      {}, 
      ...]

getting comments:
    `const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/comments?" + `
                               `new URLSearchParams({photo_id: ID}));`
  response:
    array of json data objects
    [{body: str,
      date: str,
      gravatar: img linkstr ,
      name: str,
      photo_id: num}, 
    ...]

updating likes/favorites:
    async function retrievePhotos() {
    const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/photos/like", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({photo_id: ID}),
      });       
    const jsonData = await response.json();
    console.log(jsonData);
    }
  response:
    {total: num}

submitting comment:
    async function submitComment() {
      const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/comments/new", {
          method: "POST",
          headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({photo_id: 1, body: 'hey im body', name: 'jedd', email: 'stephen@gmail.com'}),
        });       
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      console.log(jsonData);
    }
  response:
    {body: str, name: str, date: str, photo_id: num, gravatar: str}

ALGORITHM
- init gallery
  - init view
  - retrieve all slides
    (fetch GET "http://localhost:3000/photos")
  - init `Photos` object with array response from server
  - display homepage('next')
      - get `nextphoto` from photos
      - send `photoInfo` to view
      V - fills `slide` handlebars with object
      - send `statInfo` to view
      V - fills `stats` handlebars with object
      - set currentID
      - show comments
        - retrieve comments for that photo, determined by ID
          (fetch GET "http://localhost:3000/comments?" +
                        new URLSearchParams({photo_id:  ID});)
        - send `Comments` to view
        V - fills handlebars with those comments


- init view
